# Countries V2 API display

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrates with the REST Countries V2 API to pull country data and display it. You can access the design instructions in this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/yibnsJAbCTBjeBYpWjkuB0/Untitled?node-id=1%3A24).

- [ ] Search for a country using an input field
- [ ] Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page

### Requirements - extra
- [ ] E2E tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Color mode toggle
- [ ] Filter countries by region
- [ ] Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## Run locally

In the project directory:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Test

In the project directory:

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Build
In the project directory:

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
